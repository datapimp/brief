# Summary

The Blueprint by Architects.io is a functional specifications and requirements document that joins together various materials produced by Software Architects, Domain Modelers, Researchers, UX and UI Designers, Engineers, and Product Managers.  The overall purpose is to communicate design intent, vision, and goals, along with the strategy and logistics of implementation.  

Our aim is to reduce the overall communication effort required to deliver products whose results more closely match the intent and goals.  This requires more effective communication tools, a more effortless feedback loop, and a methodology for validating and refining the goals themselves as everyone's understanding develops.
