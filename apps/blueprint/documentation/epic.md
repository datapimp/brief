# Feature Epics

The Feature Epic model is a document that is used to document a bunch of
related user stories related to a general feature category or group.

For example you might have a "3rd Party Integrations" Epic which has
User Stories for LinkedIn, Facebook, Github, and Twitter.  

The Epic Document can be used to describe the importance of the module 
as a whole at the same time that it captures the user stories.
