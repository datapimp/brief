# Software Blueprint

Why are you building what you are building, and how you will measure
whether it is successful?  Which projects are required to accomplish the
overall vision, and how will they relate to one another? What are the core
concepts of the domain? How will the information be organized? What are
the different screens that need to be developed, and how should actions
taken on these screens be relayed to a database or an API? 

Developing a successful software project with a team of designers,
developers, marketers, and project managers requires maintaining an attention to
detail as well as clarity and alignment on the big picture.  And it
requires this over a long period of time, as things change and evolve,
and as members of the team come and go.

Consider this a living guide for your software project, telling you where you are today, how you got here, and where you are going next month and how you will get there.
