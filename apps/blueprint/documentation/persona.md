#### Personas

Personas are used to help understand the different audiences for the software.  

Persona models can be used in a lot of clever ways, beyond just
describing who they are.

In a set of features, there will be user stories.  User stories have a predictable structure, and because of this it is possible to query all of the user stories and filter them by persona.  

This gives us a view into the product design development that is
centered around a specific persona, which can be a very useful way to look at a set of features.
