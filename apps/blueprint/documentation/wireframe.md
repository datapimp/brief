##### Wireframes

Mockups are notes that acompany a screen or user interface mockup.

Mockups can include data about annotations (like x,y coordinates) which will map up with the headings of the document.

This is a good way to display annotated wireframes and talk about the integration points between the User Interface and the domain model, or just provide explanation about the wireframe itself.
