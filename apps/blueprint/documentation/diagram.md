#### Blueprint Diagram

The Diagram model is useful for combining notes with an SVG diagram.  

One workflow I like to use is building a UML Diagram in Google Draw, and exporting it as SVG.  Then using a tool like Adobe Illustrator, I will group the elements of the diagram, and then assign IDs and Classes to them.  

The Diagram document allows for a section called Annotations.  The Annotations section will be parsed, and treated as data.  This allows for rendering the diagram document, along with the diagram itself, and displaying the annotations in a novel way.
