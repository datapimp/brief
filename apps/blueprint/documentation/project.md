#### Projects

Any large software effort will consist of a Software Project,
sometimes but not always represented by a single codebase or git
repository.

The blueprint itself will have many epics, features, user stories.  It will have mockups, wireframes, sitemaps.  There will be domain concepts to talk about, personas to consider, etc.  Projects are a good way to slice these up, and summarize things.
