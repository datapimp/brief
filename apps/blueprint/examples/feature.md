# App Browsing

A briefcase can be configured to use an existing "app" instead of defining all of the models and such every time.

These apps can be shared over github, and can be browsed by others so that they can use the models themselves.

# User Stories

- As a **programmer** I would like to **publish my app to the
  community repository** so that I can **share my inventions with
  others**
