# Brief Writing Toolkit

This is a description of the project.

This document could very easily be broken apart into much smaller,
more focused documents, and indeed it should be.  

When starting a blueprint, you might want to just start at the project
level since often you will know ahead of time how you might structure
the solution by project.
