# Apps Repositories

The Brief project has the concept of an `app`.  An `app` is a
collection of models that represent different templates for
documents that you can write which can then be processed by the brief `app` in question and be used to do specific things.

# Features

## App Browsing

- As a **writer** I would like to **view the available brief apps** so that I can **take advantage of creative writing automation ideas contributed by others**

- As a **programmer** I would like to **publish my app to the
  community repository** so that I can **share my inventions with
  others**

## Model Documentation

- As a **writer** I would like to **understand the way my writing can be turned into data** so that I can **present my writing in more compelling forms** 

- As a **programmer** I would like to **document the model
  behavior** so that I can **provide a more usable interface to the writer**

## Example Documents

- As a **writer** I would like to **see examples of other
  documents** so that I can **conform to the document structure**
